I was the encoder. We worked together on designing the data structures,
I wrote the code for the stack, the queue(with help from Oskar), append(), buildCode(), printTree(),dumpTree(), and encode.c.

My partner did his fair share without a doubt, he wrote decode.c, stepTree(), loadTree(), nextBit()
and helped envisioning all the data structures.

HOW TO USE
compile using 
$ make all
encode a file using
$ encode -i infile -o outfile
decode a file using
$ decode -i outfile(from decode) -o finalOutFile
